SOV_address_the_supreme_soviet_desc: "We must address the Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet is the main legislative branch of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. However, the Supreme Soviet is only in session a couple of times a year and because of this it makes each session a momentous event. We have many things to talk about, but on the top of the list by far is the state of the economy. The state of the soviet economy has not changed since the death of Lenin in 1924, many people think we should build a completely new system, others think we should continue with Lenin's state capitalism. This event will be a major stepping stone for the Soviet Union."
