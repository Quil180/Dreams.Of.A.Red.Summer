ITA_italy.1.d:0 "The Palazzo Venezia has been very lively recently as the Fascist Council prepares its first session of the year. Not too far away from all the action, Il Duce Benito Mussolini is in his office. He is fixing his tie and preparing his speech when suddenly a knock on his door. “Il Duce?” Benito responds with a calm “Come in”, Achille Starce opens the door and walks towards Il Duce “Il Duce everyone is waiting for you at the Palazzo Venezia”. Mussolini stands up, straightens his brown belt and walks towards the door.\n\nThe chamber doors open, and Il Duce walks in, everybody stands up and performs the now-iconic Roman Salute. Il Duce begins walking down the Chamber to get to his podium, the only thing that can be heard are the footsteps of his black boots clapping against the marble floor. Il Duce reaches his podium and takes a sip of water.\n\n“Comrades! Brothers!” Mussolini shouts. “Victory in Ethiopia is certain, our armies have routed our savage enemies back into the mountains! No one can deny Italian superiority in the Mediterranean anymore!”. All attendees \nstand to cheer Il Duce. However the cheering doesn’t stop, no one dares stop out of sheer fear.\n"
