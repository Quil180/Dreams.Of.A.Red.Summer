ITAS_italy_starting.1.d:0 "Italy, the birthplace of modern fascism. As one of the victors of the First World War, Italy expected a large reward, however, they were rewarded very little. The public anger at this state of affairs, along with post-war economic decline saw the rise of radical movements in Italy.\n\nOne of these movements was the Italian Fascists primarily led by Benito Mussolini, Fascism was the idea that democracy had to be removed and you would be freer because of it. Benito, the disillusioned socialist founded his Partito Nazionale Fascista in Milan in 1919, with the goal of creating a fascist government. This all accumulated in the march on Rome in 1922 which saw the rise of Mussolini and his Blackshirts. \n\nNot long after this so-called ‘Blackshirt Revolution’ Mussolini began his plans for Balkan domination, with Serbia getting stronger and stronger every coming year Italy had to step up their game. The Balkan Act was signed into the legislation in 1930 along with a trade embargo on Serbia, and soft guarantees of independence on Slovenia and Croatia. Mussolini initially hoped that the United Kingdom and France would join in and also start embargos on Serbia, but such an act was never made by either the United Kingdom or France. \n\nNow, Mussolini and his Fascist government have started a war in Ethiopia with the goal of extending their borders in Africa. With that war soon ending, Italy must eye up some other territories to take. With the Balkans being as unstable as ever, now seems like the golden opportunity to expand to these former Austrian subjects.\n"
